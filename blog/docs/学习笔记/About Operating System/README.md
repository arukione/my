### What is Operating System?

Technically speaking, it's the first layer of software configured on the computer hardware. It is the first extension of the hardware system.

It is responsible for managing the equipment, improving the utilization rate of the hardware and the throughput of the system. And providing a simple interface for users and applications.

### Target

There are four primary target of configure the Operating System on computer system:
**Conveniences, Effectiveness, Extensibility, Openness**

A computer system that doesn't have an OS is extremely difficult to use.
Users must use machine language to write programs that can run directly on computer hardware.

The system can use compile commands to compile programs written by users in high-level languages into machine code, or operate the computer system directly through various commands provided by the OS, which greatly faciltates users

Effectiveness includes the first meaning is to improve the utilization of system resources, another meaning is to imporve the throughput of the system.
OS can speed up program running and shorten program running cycle by organizing computer workflow properly.

The openness means that the system can comply with the world standards and specifications, especially the Open System Interconnection(OSI) standard.
In fact, hardware and software developed in compliance withe international standards are compatible with each other and can be easily interlinked.

### The Role of OS

1. As the interface between the user and the computer hardware system, user through OS uses the computer system.
2. As the manager of computer system resources, it mainly manage processors, memory, I/O devices and files(data and programs) effectively.
3. The OS is a abstraction of computer resources, there is Conveniences to the users.
